If you do not know what ur doing, stick to a well vetted encryption app like https://github.com/str4d/rage  

Unlike other repos that post a crypto app and do not ever come back for 4 years to update it... lots of thought went into this. Each dir is its own app. App code is all in main.rs ! The MVC pattern is just silly in lots of cases, and idk bout you, but i find it annoying to look at an app where there are 30 rs files. Mine are all tight, in one main.rs .  As such it is absurdly and incredibly easy to feed to chatgpt or any ai to audit for security, check to make sure the readme is correct, or make any changes you want. One could not ask for more. I do not have a mac, so all are only compiled on linux or win. Some are linux or win specific. For reference, chatgpt 5 pro made all these, so if you feed main.rs to ai, make sure it is a superior model to what i used. Also all code is as is, and i might change lines at any time. I do not bother with versioning i just overwrite the main files.
